# Entities

2. Vendor (Clients of TSP: Kirana shops, Online Commerce, etc.)
3. Vendor's Customer

---

# Flow
1. TSP has an admin panel to manage and onboard vendors.
2. TSP fills in all details and creates a new vendor.
3. Vendor integrates TSP into their platform (POS/Online Commerce Website).
4. When a user selects the online payment method, the vendor's platform sends:
   - order_id
   - cart_amount
   - vendor_id (provided by TSP)
5. TSP's payment page displays:
   - Vendor Name  
   - Vendor Contact Number  
   - Checkout Amount  
   - Available Payment Methods (UPI, Credit Card, etc.)
6. The user (vendor’s customer) selects a payment method and completes the payment.
7. After payment, TSP's payment page sends the following to the vendor’s checkout page:
   - Final_amount
   - payment_status
   - order_id
8. Vendor's checkout page verifies these details:
   - If details match, check payment_status.
9. If payment_status = success, mark the order as placed; otherwise, mark it as failed.

   (Stores transaction details, now without foreign keys, but with vendor data copied from Vendor Table)  
   - transaction_id
   - payment_status
   - payment_method (UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card, Internet Banking)
   - final_amount
   - checkout_amount
   - vender_id
   - Today's datetime
   - Last Modified DateTime

2. Fianl_Amount Calculation on TSP’s Payment Page  
   If the customer bears the fee: 
   	Final_Amount = Checkout_Amount + (2% of Checkout_Amount) + (18% GST on 2% Fee)
   Else:
	Final_Amount = Checkout_Amount

3. If Transaction not_found / status=pending: => 
   - Insert into Transaction_Table if not_found
   - Template (html page) with final_amount and payment_options will displays.
	3.1 If 'UPI' selected => 
	    - Enter the upi-id => Proceed to Pay => 
	    - Popup with success and Fail Btn will displays (As its prototype). => On btn click...
		3.2 URL => site/payments/payment_Id/updated_status hits..
		3.3 Update Transaction Data for given payment_Id..
		3.4 Redirects to STEP 1
	3.2 Same for all other payment methods
